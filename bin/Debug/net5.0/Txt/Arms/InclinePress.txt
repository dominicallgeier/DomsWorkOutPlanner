The incline is a nice compromise between the overhead and bench presses. 
It works mostly the clavicular pecs instead of the sternal ones, while still giving 
a lot of work to the delts (drive) and tris (finish). At the same time it is a 
little easier on the lower back than the overhead version since the isolated position 
on a supportive bench stabilizes the lumbar spine. Unlike the bench press, bridging 
or even just arching is not really possible. So the incline press is an honest one.
