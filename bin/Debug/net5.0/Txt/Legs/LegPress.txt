There is less risk of injury when using the leg press machine as compared with using
free weights like squats and deadlifts. The leg press machine can help beginners gain
more strength and endurance in the lower body to perform more advanced 
leg exercises including powerlifting exercises such as squats and deadlifts.
The leg press machine also promotes bone development in the same way as muscle development.
