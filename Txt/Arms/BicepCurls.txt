Curls work the biceps muscles at the front of the upper arm, and also the muscles of the 
lower armâ€”the brachialis, and brachioradialis. You use these muscles anytime you pick something up, which 
is common throughout daily life. Doing the arm curl, you build strength and learn to use your arm 
muscles correctly, bracing with your core muscles.
