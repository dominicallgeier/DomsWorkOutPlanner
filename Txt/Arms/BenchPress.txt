Bench press is considered a compound exercise. 
A compound exercise uses multiple muscle groups and joints at the same time, compared with 
an isometric exercise which involves the static contraction of a muscle without any visible 
movement in the angle of the joint. Bench press primarily works the pectoralis major, with 
secondary muscles which involve the shoulders, triceps, biceps and shoulder joints.
