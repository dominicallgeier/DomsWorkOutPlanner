Lunges work the large muscle groups in your lower body, which builds leans muscle and reduces body fat. 
This can increase your resting metabolism, which allows you to burn more calories and trim excess weight.
Lunges are a lower body unilateral exercise since you work on each side of your body independently. 
The single-leg movements activate your stabilizing muscles to develop balance, coordination, and stability.
