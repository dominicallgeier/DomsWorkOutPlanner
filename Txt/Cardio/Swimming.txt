Swimming uses all the muscles in the body so whether you swim a gentle breaststroke or hammer 
butterfly, you will get a full body workout. Plus, exercising in water 
makes your body work harder so 30 minutes in a pool is worth 45 minutes of the same activity on land.
Swimming is one of the most effective ways to burn calories. A gentle swim can burn 
over 200 calories in just half an hour, more than double that of walking.
