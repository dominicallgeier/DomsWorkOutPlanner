Cycling habitually, especially at a high intensity, can help lower your body 
fat levels, which promotes healthy weight management. Cycling improves overall function 
in your lower body and strengthens your leg muscles without overstressing your joints. It targets 
your quads, glutes, hamstrings, and calves.
