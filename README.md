# DomsWorkOutPlanner
I decided to make this project because I enjoy working out and it is always nice to plan 
out a workout ahead of time, so you know exactly what you want to do. There are a lot of 
times when I go in and my head goes blank on exercises I wanted to do. This project lets 
the user navigate through and select basic workouts for their arms, legs, and cardio. It also 
allows them to check their BMI. In this project I use four features: Master Loop for the user 
going and selecting however many workouts they want before they exit, I have a List that 
records the user’s input so I can display it when they exit, I am also reading from a txt 
file so that the user can have some idea of the workout they chose and what it does for 
them, and finally I added a BMI calculator that converts pounds/inches into kg/meters.
